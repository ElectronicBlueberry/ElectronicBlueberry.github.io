# Hey!

My Name is Laila and this is my (mainly software development) blog / showcase / portfolio!

I like building things, always learning, and working towards a more open + inclusive web.

On this site I write about things I built, and collect blog/news posts I built elsewhere.
Have a look around to get a feel for what I do!
