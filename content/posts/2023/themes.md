Galaxy 23.0 comes with a new theming system, which lays out the ground work for a fully themeable Galaxy. Themes differ from past customization options by allowing users to switch between themes while Galaxy is running. In their current iteration, they are implemented only in the masthead, but will be rolled out to allow for theming many more parts of Galaxy in the future.
