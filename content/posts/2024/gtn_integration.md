For many tools in Galaxy, the GTN offers a variety of guides, practical examples, and help throughout it’s many tutorials. Often times when using a tool, such information can be very useful, but hard to discover.

Galaxy’s new GTN Tool-Form integration helps with this, by connecting Galaxy to the GTN, and displaying all tutorials which make use of the tool you are currently using, directly inside to Tool Form!
